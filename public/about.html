<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey everyone,it's awesome to meet you guys. Thank you for visiting my website. Let me quickly introduce myself
   Hi! I am Tiasa Munshi, currently pursuing Btech in Electronics and Communication from NIT Manipur and I'm so excited
   about creating my first ever real project in Web development.
</p>
<p>
  I know this isn't much and I've got to keep learning to improve myself, but still this is something which I have
  created on my own and I hope it's okay to feel a bit proud about it. Though I know that I still have a long way to
  go to become a full stack web developer. 
</p>

<p>
  There are times where I don't want to do anything and lose motivation lol. Yeah, I know I am full of flaws but I will
  keep trying to improve and challenge myself everyday. I want you guys to be with me in this journey and together, let's win this.
  Cuz that's what they say, when life gives you lemons, make free-ka lemonade with it(I'm Indian, and I dunno any Indian who doesn't like free stuffs lmao)
