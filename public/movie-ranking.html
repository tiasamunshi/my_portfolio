<hr />
<h3> Three Idiots</h3>
<p> Highly entertaining with a tinge of nostalgia for the generation who have already passed their uni lives.it teaches us how to fight against odds and the standard societal norms and fight for our dreams </p>
<h3> Taare Zameen Par </h3>
<p> Shows us that every child is unique on their own and how the in-built system of growing up forces them to supress their talents and live in seclusion, just cuz they aren't like the rest of them.
<h3> Dangal </h3>
<p> A biography about two sisters and their father who challeneged the entire world and stood up against all odds to chase their dreams and shine. A definite must watch for all.
